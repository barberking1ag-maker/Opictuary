## 💡 PRO TIPS

### For Filing:
1. **File in priority order:** Prison Access, Dynamic QR, Bluetooth Audio first (most unique)
2. **Double-check entity status:** Select "Micro Entity" for $65 fee (not $130 or $260)
3. **Save all confirmation emails:** Proof of filing date
4. **Print receipts immediately:** USPTO system can be slow to email

### For "Patent Pending" Marketing:
1. **Add to website footer:** "Patent Pending Technology"
2. **Add to pitch decks:** Shows innovation and IP value
3. **Add to investor materials:** Increases valuation
4. **Add to QR codes/marketing:** "Patent Pending Memorial Platform"

### For 12-Month Timeline:
1. **Set calendar reminder at Month 10:** Start preparing for full patent filing
2. **Budget for full patents:** $10K-20K per patent (or DIY for $364+ each)
3. **Option to abandon less valuable patents:** Don't have to convert all 7
4. **Prioritize:** Prison Access + Dynamic QR are strongest, convert those first

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED FILING STRATEGY

### Week 1 (This Week):
**File Top 3 Patents - $195**
1. Prison Access System
2. Dynamic QR Code System
3. Bluetooth Funeral Audio

**Why these 3 first:**
- Most unique (100% novel)
- Strongest patent potential
- Highest commercial value
- Immediate "Patent Pending" protection

### Month 2-3:
**File Remaining 4 Patents - $260**
4. Hood Memorials
5. Essential Worker System
6. Multi-Revenue Model
7. Celebrity Verification

**Why delay these:**
- Lower cost upfront ($195 vs. $455)
- Still get 12-month protection for all
- Time to see which innovations get most user traction
- Can skip less valuable ones if needed
