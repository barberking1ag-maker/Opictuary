## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM

### Americans Spend $20B Annually on Death Care, But Digital Memorial Services Are Broken

**Pain Points:**

1. **Scattered Memorial Content**
   - Photos on Facebook, videos on YouTube, obituaries on newspapers
   - No centralized platform for families to preserve memories
   - Content lost when social media accounts close

2. **Limited Revenue Models**
   - Funeral homes earn 90% of revenue, families get nothing
   - No way for communities to financially support grieving families
   - No connection between physical memorials (tombstones) and digital presence

3. **Underserved Markets Ignored**
   - 2.3M incarcerated individuals can't access memorial tributes
   - Essential workers (police, firefighters, EMTs) lack dedicated memorial systems
   - Hood/neighborhood communities have no platform for collective mourning

4. **Existing Platforms Are Outdated**
   - Legacy.com: Basic obituaries from 1998, no mobile app
   - GatheringUs: Virtual services only, limited features
   - No innovation in 25+ years

**Market Opportunity:** $900M serviceable addressable market with 12-15% annual growth
