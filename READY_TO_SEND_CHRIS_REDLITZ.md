**To:** chris@transmediacapital.com  
**Subject:** Opictuary - Prison Memorial Access Platform ($500K Seed)

---

Hi Chris,

I'm reaching out because you're the #1 person I wanted to talk to about what we're building at Opictuary.

**The problem:** 2.3 million incarcerated individuals can't access online memorials when loved ones pass away. They can't see photos, can't read tributes, can't participate in the digital grieving process. This isolation makes the hardest moments of incarceration even harder.

**Our solution:** A secure memorial access system deployed on prison kiosks - the same infrastructure JPay and GTL use. Incarcerated individuals can request access to specific memorials, pay using existing commissary accounts ($0.15/minute, just like phone calls), and view memorial content in time-limited sessions. Everything is monitored and logged for security.

**Why this fits The Last Mile's mission:**
- Technology access that maintains family connections ✓
- Supports rehabilitation through grief processing ✓
- Generates revenue for facilities (30% commission) ✓
- Zero competition in a $500M+ market ✓

**What we've built so far:**
- 88 active users, 48% monthly growth (100% organic)
- Production-ready platform with 6 revenue streams
- Patent-pending prison access system (filing provisional this month)
- Partnership discussions with 3 funeral home chains
- B2B partnerships with flower shops and merchandise vendors

**The round:**
- Raising: $500K-$750K seed
- Valuation: $3.5M pre-money
- Use of funds: 50% marketing, 20% partnerships (funeral homes + correctional facilities), 10% patent protection, 20% operations

**Why I'm reaching out to you specifically:**
Your work with The Last Mile proves that technology can transform incarceration outcomes when designed thoughtfully. The prison memorial access system is exactly that - technology that serves a genuine human need while respecting security requirements.

I know the prison tech space intimately from our systems design - we've mapped integration paths for JPay, GTL, Securus, and ViaPath. We've designed the verification flow, payment processing, and monitoring dashboard specifically for correctional administrators.

**Would you be open to a 15-minute call next week to discuss?**

I can walk through the platform demo, show the prison access system architecture, and share our partnership pipeline (which includes conversations with two state corrections departments).

Best regards,

P.S. - I've attached our executive summary and pitch deck. The prison access section starts on slide 8, and I think you'll see immediately why this is a perfect fit for your investment thesis.

Hi Chris,

Just wanted to bump this up in your inbox in case it got buried. 

Still very interested in connecting about our prison memorial
