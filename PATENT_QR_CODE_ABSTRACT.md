## Dynamic QR Code Memorial Upload System - Abstract

---

### ABSTRACT

A dynamic QR code system enables public photo and video upload to digital memorials through scannable codes printed on physical memorial artifacts. The system generates unique QR codes encoding memorial identifiers and context parameters, prints codes on tombstone plaques, memorial cards, and funeral programs, and provides context-aware mobile interfaces based on scan source. When scanned with smartphones, QR codes present appropriate actions: tombstone codes offer grave site photo upload, memorial cards show action menus, and all codes enable general content upload. Mobile upload operates entirely in web browsers without requiring app installation or account creation. Users select photos or videos from device cameras or libraries, optionally provide their name and relationship, and submit content to a moderation queue where memorial owners review uploads before publication. Tombstone photos are automatically categorized separately and organized chronologically to document grave appearance over time. The system tracks QR scan analytics including scans by source (tombstone/card/program), conversion rates from scans to uploads, and device types. This invention bridges physical memorial artifacts with digital memorial platforms, enabling cemetery visitors, memorial card holders, and funeral attendees to easily contribute photos and videos, creating richer memorials that grow over decades as descendants continue using printed QR codes.
