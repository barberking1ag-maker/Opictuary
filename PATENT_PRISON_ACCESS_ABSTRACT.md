## Prison Memorial Access System - Abstract

### ABSTRACT

A secure memorial access system enables incarcerated individuals to view digital memorials of deceased loved ones through monitored kiosk terminals in correctional facilities. The system comprises a memorial platform hosting photos, videos, and tributes; a prison access module integrating with existing kiosk infrastructure; identity verification using prison credentials; payment processing through commissary accounts and third-party prison payment vendors (JPay, GTL, ViaPath); time-limited session management; comprehensive activity logging; content filtering for security; and administrative oversight dashboards. Incarcerated individuals request access to specific memorials, pay on a per-minute basis ($0.15-$0.30/minute), and view memorial content in secure sessions (15-60 minutes). Families can pre-approve access or respond to access requests. All activity is monitored and logged for security compliance. Revenue is automatically shared between the platform operator and correctional facilities (typically 70/30 split). The system supports multiple facilities simultaneously with facility-specific configurations, adapts to different payment vendors, and scales across federal, state, and local correctional institutions. This invention solves the problem of digital isolation during grief, maintains family connections critical for rehabilitation, generates revenue for facilities, and operates in a zero-competition market serving 2.3 million incarcerated individuals.
