## TITLE OF INVENTION

**System and Method for Creating Interactive Memorial Timelines with Holiday, Anniversary, and Life Event Commemorations with Automated Reminder Notifications**

---

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

### The Problem

After someone passes, significant dates become emotionally charged:

1. **Holiday Grief:** First Christmas, Thanksgiving, birthdays without loved ones are difficult.

2. **Anniversary Management:** Families want reminders for death anniversary, wedding anniversary, etc.

3. **Milestone Recognition:** Birthdays, graduations, and other dates that would have been celebrated.

4. **Scattered Dates:** Important dates are remembered by different family members without centralization.

5. **Context Loss:** New generations don't know which holidays were special to the deceased.

### Prior Art Deficiencies

**Calendar Apps:** General purpose, not memorial-focused.

**Memorial Platforms:** Static pages without timeline or reminder features.

**Anniversary Services:** Generic reminders without memorial context.
