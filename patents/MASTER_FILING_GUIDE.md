## Part 6: Important Dates & Reminders

### Set These Calendar Reminders

**Monthly:**
- Check USPTO Patent Center for any correspondence
- Check Trademark Status (after filing)

**At Filing + 11 Months (for each patent):**
- "DECISION NEEDED: Convert [Patent Name] to non-provisional?"
- Review commercial value
- Decide to convert, PCT, or let expire

**At Filing + 12 Months (for each patent):**
- "DEADLINE: Non-provisional filing due for [Patent Name]"
- File non-provisional if decided
- Or acknowledge expiration

**Trademark (Year 5):**
- "Section 8 Declaration due for OPICTUARY"
- File between 5th and 6th anniversary

**Trademark (Year 10):**
- "Section 8 & 9 Declaration due for OPICTUARY"
- File between 9th and 10th anniversary

---

## Part 7: Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Patent Mistakes

1. **Missing 12-month deadline** - Provisional expires, priority lost
2. **Insufficient description** - Not enough detail to support claims
3. **Public disclosure before filing** - 1-year grace period (US only)
4. **Forgetting Micro Entity certification** - Pay full fee instead of reduced

### Trademark Mistakes

1. **Not searching first** - Application rejected for existing mark
2. **Wrong classification** - Protection doesn't cover actual use
3. **Missing maintenance** - Registration cancelled
4. **Generic terms** - Can't trademark "Memorial Platform"

### Copyright Mistakes

1. **Assuming automatic registration** - Must register to sue
2. **Waiting too long** - Register within 3 months of publication for statutory damages
3. **Incorrect deposit** - Application rejected

## Part 9: Post-Provisional Conversion Planning

### 9.1 Understanding Non-Provisional Filing

A provisional patent application:
- Establishes a priority date
- Lasts exactly 12 months
- Does NOT mature into a patent automatically
- Must be converted to non-provisional to get patent protection

### 9.2 Conversion Decision Framework

**At Month 11, evaluate each patent:**

| Factor | Keep (Convert) | Let Expire |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| Commercial Traction | Product uses this feature | Feature not implemented |
| Competitive Threat | Competitors copying | No competition |
| Licensing Interest | Inquiries received | No interest |
| Market Validation | Customer demand | No validation |
| Cost/Benefit | Revenue justifies cost | Costs outweigh benefits |

**Recommendation:** Convert 30-50% of provisionals (typically 7-11 of 22)

### 9.3 Non-Provisional Filing Costs (Per Patent)
