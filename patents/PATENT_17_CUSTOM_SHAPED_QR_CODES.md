## TITLE OF INVENTION

**System and Method for Generating and Manufacturing Custom-Shaped QR Codes with Memorial Iconography Integration for Physical Memorial Products**

---

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to QR code technology and memorial products, specifically to a system for generating QR codes in custom shapes (hearts, crosses, Stars of David, doves) that maintain scannability while incorporating memorial-appropriate iconography for physical memorial products.

---

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

### The Problem

Standard square QR codes are aesthetically limited for memorial contexts:

1. **Visual Mismatch:** Square QR codes look out of place on curved monuments, heart-shaped products, and artistic memorials.

2. **Brand Disconnect:** Generic QR appearance doesn't convey memorial purpose or emotional context.

3. **Design Integration:** Designers struggle to incorporate square codes into organic memorial designs.

4. **Cultural Insensitivity:** Standard codes lack faith-specific or cultural design elements.

### Prior Art Deficiencies

**Standard QR Generators:** Square-only output without shape customization.

**Logo QR Generators:** Center logo placement only, not shape modification.

**Artistic QR Services:** General designs, not memorial-focused or culturally-sensitive.

---

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides:

1. **Custom Shape QR Generation** maintaining scannability in non-square forms
2. **Memorial Iconography Integration** (hearts, crosses, doves, Stars of David)
3. **Faith-Specific Designs** for multiple religious traditions
4. **Manufacturing Integration** for embossing, laser-cutting, and printing

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

### Supported Shapes

```
MEMORIAL QR SHAPES:
├── UNIVERSAL
│   ├── Heart shape
│   ├── Oval/ellipse
│   ├── Circle
│   ├── Dove silhouette
│   └── Tree of life
│
├── CHRISTIAN
│   ├── Cross shape
│   ├── Angel silhouette
│   └── Praying hands
│
├── JEWISH

```

### Technical Implementation

```
SHAPE PRESERVATION ALGORITHM:
1. Define target shape outline
2. Calculate usable QR area within shape
3. Apply error correction (Level H - 30%)
4. Position finder patterns at corners
5. Distribute data modules across shape
6. Validate scannability with multiple devices
7. Generate manufacturing-ready output
```

## CLAIMS

**Claim 1:** A system for generating custom-shaped QR codes for memorial products, comprising shape definition, scannability-preserving module distribution, and manufacturing output generation.

**Claim 2:** A method for creating faith-specific QR code shapes (crosses, Stars of David, crescents) that maintain error correction and device compatibility.

**Claim 3:** A system for integrating custom QR shapes into physical memorial product manufacturing workflows.

---

## ABSTRACT

A system and method for generating custom-shaped QR codes incorporating memorial iconography for physical memorial products. The invention enables QR codes in shapes such as hearts, crosses, Stars of David, and doves while maintaining scannability through high error correction and optimized module placement. The system integrates with manufacturing processes for laser cutting, embossing, and printing on memorial products.
