## TITLE OF INVENTION

**System and Method for Connecting Memorial Platform Users with QR-Enabled Physical Memorial Product Manufacturers Through Integrated Ordering, Fulfillment, and Revenue Sharing Infrastructure**

---

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to e-commerce platforms for memorial products, specifically to a B2B system connecting digital memorial platforms with physical product manufacturers (plaques, headstones, jewelry) enabling integrated ordering, QR code provisioning, fulfillment tracking, and automated revenue sharing.

---

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

### The Problem

The memorial product supply chain is fragmented:

1. **Manufacturer Discovery:** Families struggle to find quality QR memorial product manufacturers.

2. **Platform Disconnection:** Memorial platforms and physical product manufacturers operate independently.

3. **QR Provisioning Gap:** Products with QR codes require integration between digital memorial and physical manufacturer.

4. **Order Complexity:** Families must separately order from manufacturers and set up digital memorials.

5. **Quality Assurance:** No standardized quality or durability requirements for QR memorial products.

6. **Revenue Fragmentation:** No integrated revenue sharing between platforms and manufacturers.

### Prior Art Deficiencies

**Etsy/Amazon:** General marketplaces without memorial platform integration.

**Direct Manufacturer Sales:** No platform integration or QR provisioning.

**Memorial Platforms:** No manufacturer network or product fulfillment.

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides:

1. **Manufacturer Network** curating quality QR memorial product makers
2. **Platform Integration** connecting digital memorials with physical products
3. **QR Provisioning System** generating and linking QR codes at manufacturing
4. **Order Management** tracking from purchase through delivery
5. **Quality Standards** ensuring durability and scannability
6. **Revenue Sharing** automated commission splits between platform and manufacturers
