## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

### The Problem

Pet loss is a significant emotional experience affecting millions:

1. **Human Memorial Inappropriateness:** Standard memorial platforms designed for humans don't fit pet memorial needs.

2. **Species Diversity:** Dogs, cats, horses, birds, fish, and exotic pets require different templates.

3. **Lack of Integration:** Veterinary records, microchip databases, and pet registries aren't connected to memorials.

4. **Underserved Grief:** Pet loss grief support is limited compared to human loss resources.

5. **Multi-Pet Families:** Families need systems to memorialize multiple pets over time.

### Prior Art Deficiencies

**Human Memorial Platforms:** Not designed for pet memorial needs.

**Pet Cemetery Sites:** Physical location focus without rich digital features.

**Social Media Pet Accounts:** No memorial-specific functionality.
