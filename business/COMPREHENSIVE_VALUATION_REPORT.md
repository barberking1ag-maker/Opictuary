### 1.2 Patent Valuation Methodology

**Per-Patent Valuation Formula:**
```
Patent Value = (Addressable Market × Market Capture Rate × Revenue Multiple) × Defensibility Factor

Where:
- Addressable Market = Specific market segment size
- Market Capture Rate = Expected market share (1-10%)
- Revenue Multiple = Industry standard (3-5x for SaaS)
- Defensibility Factor = Uniqueness multiplier (0.5-2.0)
```
