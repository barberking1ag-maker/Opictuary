## EMAIL VERSION 1: DIRECT & FOCUSED (Recommended)

**To:** chris@transmediacapital.com  
**Subject:** Opictuary - Prison Memorial Access Platform ($500K Seed)

---

Hi Chris,

I'm reaching out because you're the #1 person I wanted to talk to about what we're building at Opictuary.

**The problem:** 2.3 million incarcerated individuals can't access online memorials when loved ones pass away. They can't see photos, can't read tributes, can't participate in the digital grieving process. This isolation makes the hardest moments of incarceration even harder.

**Our solution:** A secure memorial access system deployed on prison kiosks - the same infrastructure JPay and GTL use. Incarcerated individuals can request access to specific memorials, pay using existing commissary accounts ($0.15/minute, just like phone calls), and view memorial content in time-limited sessions. Everything is monitored and logged for security.

**Why this fits The Last Mile's mission:**
- Technology access that maintains family connections ✓
- Supports rehabilitation through grief processing ✓
- Generates revenue for facilities (30% commission) ✓
- Zero competition in a $500M+ market ✓

**What we've built so far:**
- 88 active users, 48% monthly growth (100% organic)
- Production-ready platform with 6 revenue streams
- Patent-pending prison access system (filing provisional this month)
- Partnership discussions with 3 funeral home chains
- B2B partnerships with flower shops and merchandise vendors

**The round:**
- Raising: $500K-$750K seed
- Valuation: $3.5M pre-money
- Use of funds: 50% marketing, 20% partnerships (funeral homes + correctional facilities), 10% patent protection, 20% operations

**Why I'm reaching out to you specifically:**
Your work with The Last Mile proves that technology can transform incarceration outcomes when designed thoughtfully. The prison memorial access system is exactly that - technology that serves a genuine human need while respecting security requirements.

I know the prison tech space intimately from our systems design - we've mapped integration paths for JPay, GTL, Securus, and ViaPath. We've designed the verification flow, payment processing, and monitoring dashboard specifically for correctional administrators.

**Would you be open to a 15-minute call next week to discuss?**

I can walk through the platform demo, show the prison access system architecture, and share our partnership pipeline (which includes conversations with two state corrections departments).

Best regards,

P.S. - I've attached our executive summary and pitch deck. The prison access section starts on slide 8, and I think you'll see immediately why this is a perfect fit for your investment thesis.

## EMAIL VERSION 2: STORY-LED (More Emotional)

**To:** chris@transmediacapital.com  
**Subject:** Technology That Connects Incarcerated People to Deceased Loved Ones

---

Hi Chris,

**When someone dies, we gather around photos. We watch old videos. We share stories. We grieve together.**

**Unless you're one of 2.3 million Americans in prison.**

Then you're cut off. No access to the memorial page your family created. No way to see the photos everyone else is viewing. No ability to read the tributes pouring in. Just isolation during the hardest moment of your life.

**I'm building Opictuary to change this.**

We've created a secure memorial access system that works on prison kiosks - the same infrastructure used for JPay and GTL services. Incarcerated individuals can:
- Request access to specific memorial pages
- Pay using their existing commissary account ($0.15/minute, standard rate)
- View photos, videos, and tributes in monitored sessions
- All activity logged for security compliance

It's a simple idea that solves a profound problem.

**Why I'm reaching out to you:**

You founded The Last Mile because you understand that technology access during incarceration isn't just humane - it's smart policy. Family connections reduce recidivism. Grief processing supports mental health. And when done right, prison technology can be both secure and transformative.

Our memorial access system embodies that philosophy.

**Where we are today:**
- 88 active users, growing 48% monthly (organic)
- 6 activated revenue streams (platform fees, partnerships, prison access)
- Production-ready platform used by families across 12 states
- Patent-pending technology (filing provisional this month)
- Raising $500K-$750K at $3.5M pre-money

**I'd love 15 minutes to show you what we've built.**

I can demo the platform, walk through the prison access system architecture, and share our roadmap for corrections partnerships. I think you'll see immediately why this is both a mission-aligned opportunity and a massive untapped market.

Are you available for a call next week?
