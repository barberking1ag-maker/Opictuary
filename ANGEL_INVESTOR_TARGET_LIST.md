Hi Chris,

I'm building Opictuary, a digital memorial platform with a patent-protected 
prison access system - and you're the #1 person I wanted to reach out to.

Why this fits The Last Mile thesis:
• We're giving 2.3M incarcerated individuals access to memorials of deceased 
  loved ones via secure kiosks
• $0.15/minute revenue model (same as existing prison systems)
• Zero competition in a $500M market
• We've already designed the verification, payment, and monitoring system

Other traction:
• 88 active users, 48% monthly growth
• 6 activated revenue streams
• $3.5M pre-money valuation
• Production-ready platform

I know you're passionate about prison technology that maintains family 
connections. This is exactly that.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call next week?

✅ Follow up 2-3x (most deals close after follow-ups)
✅ Create urgency ("Closing round by [date]")
✅ Ask for intros to other investors
✅ Be responsive (reply within 1 hour during fundraise)

### Don'ts:
❌ Don't send 100-word essays (keep emails under 150 words)
❌ Don't pitch everyone at once (batch outreach weekly)
❌ Don't ignore small checks ($10K adds up!)
❌ Don't negotiate terms until you have multiple term sheets
❌ Don't forget to thank everyone (even rejections)
❌ Don't stop building (traction >>> pitching)
