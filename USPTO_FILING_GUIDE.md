---

### STEP 4: File Second Patent (Repeat Process)

`QR_Code_Provisional_Patent.pdf`

---

### STEP 5: Post-Filing Actions (Same Day)

✅ **Save Filing Receipts**
- Download both PDF receipts from USPTO emails
- Save to secure location (Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud)
- Print physical copies for records

✅ **Note Application Numbers**

- Pitch deck: Update IP slide with application numbers
- Email signature: Add "Patent Pending" notation

- Set reminder for **11 months from filing date**
- Subject: "Provisional Patents Expire in 1 Month - File Utility Patents or Let Expire"
- Note: You must file full utility patents within 12 months to maintain priority date

---

## WHAT HAPPENS AFTER FILING

### Immediate (Within 1 Hour)
- ✅ Email confirmation with application numbers
- ✅ Filing receipts available for download
- ✅ **YOU CAN NOW USE "PATENT PENDING"**

### Within 1-4 Weeks
- USPTO assigns examiner (for tracking purposes only)
- Application enters USPTO database
- You can search for it on USPTO.gov Public PAIR

### Nothing Else for 12 Months
- Provisional patents are **NOT examined**
- No office actions, no rejections, no correspondence
- USPTO holds your filing date for 12 months
- You simply have "Patent Pending" status during this time

### At 12 Months - Decision Point

**Option A: File Utility Patents ($10K-$25K each with attorney)**
- If you've raised funding
- Convert provisionals to full utility patents
- Maintain original filing date (priority date)
- USPTO examines and potentially grants full patents

**Option B: Let Provisionals Expire**
- If you haven't raised funding or pivoted
- Provisionals automatically expire at 12 months
- No refund of $150
- Innovations enter public domain
- Can no longer use "Patent Pending"

**Option C: File Second Provisionals ($150 again)**
- Rare approach: file new provisionals for another 12 months
- Loses original priority date
- Useful if you've made major improvements

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ **Don't forget cover sheet** - Add your name and contact info at the top  
❌ **Don't file as "utility patent"** - Select "provisional application"  
❌ **Don't skip payment** - Application won't be filed until paid  
❌ **Don't miss email confirmation** - Check spam folder  
❌ **Don't lose filing receipts** - Save multiple copies immediately  
❌ **Don't file late** - File this week while momentum is high  
❌ **Don't tell USPTO about Opictuary name** - Use your personal name as applicant, not company  

---

## USING "PATENT PENDING" STATUS

### Legal Language You Can Use:

✅ **Correct:**
- "Patent Pending (U.S. Provisional Patent Applications)"
- "Protected by pending U.S. Patent Applications"
- "Multiple U.S. Patents Pending"
- "Patent-Pending Technology"

❌ **Incorrect (Illegal):**
- "Patented" (you don't have granted patents yet)
- "Patent Pending" after 12 months if you didn't file utility patents
- "Patent Pending" for features not described in your applications

### Where to Use It:

**Website:**
- Footer: "© 2025 Opictuary. Patent Pending."
- About page: "Protected by 2 pending U.S. patent applications"
- Features page: Next to Prison Access and QR Code features

**Investor Materials:**
- Pitch deck IP slide: "2 Provisional Patents Filed (Nov 2024)"
- Email signature: "Opictuary - Patent Pending Memorial Platform"
- Executive summary: "Protected by provisional patents"

**Marketing:**
- App store description: "Patent-pending innovations"
- Press releases: "...featuring patented-pending technology..."
- Social media: "Proud to announce: Patent Pending status!"

## FAQ

**Q: Can I file these myself without a lawyer?**  
A: Yes! Provisional patents are designed for DIY filing. You've already written everything needed. Full utility patents later will need a lawyer.

**Q: What if I make a mistake in the application?**  
A: Provisional patents aren't examined, so minor errors don't matter. You can correct everything when/if you file utility patents.

**Q: Can I add features to the platform that aren't in the patents?**  
A: Yes, but those features won't have "Patent Pending" protection. File new provisionals for major new innovations.

**Q: Do I need to draw the diagrams?**  
A: No. The text descriptions in PATENT_*_DRAWINGS.md are sufficient for provisional filing. Full utility patents need actual drawings.

**Q: When do patents actually get granted?**  
A: Not from provisionals. Only if you file utility patents later (12-36 months after filing utility, so 2-4 years total).

**Q: Can I sell the platform with "Patent Pending"?**  
A: Yes. Patent Pending is attractive to acquirers as it shows IP protection and option to complete full patents.

**Q: What if someone copies my technology?**  
A: If you later get full patents granted, the patent protection dates back to your provisional filing date. You could potentially sue for infringement.

**Q: Can I still improve the inventions after filing?**  
A: Yes! Keep building. File continuation provisionals or add to utility patents later.
