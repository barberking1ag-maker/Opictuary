### Common Investor Questions & Answers

**Q: Why hasn't Legacy.com built this?**
A: Legacy.com is 27 years old, focused on obituary listings, and has no mobile app. They're a media company, not a platform company. Our patent-protected innovations (prison access, dynamic QR, hood memorials) require ground-up development - not retrofitting into a legacy system. Plus, we're targeting underserved niches they've ignored for decades.

**Q: How do you plan to acquire users?**
A: Four-channel strategy:
1. SEO (already ranking for "digital memorial" keywords)
2. Funeral home partnerships (recurring referrals, currently have 5 signed LOIs)
3. Prison system contracts (2.3M potential users, 18-month sales cycle underway)
4. Word-of-mouth (currently 100% organic growth at 48% monthly)

Current CAC is $0 (organic). Projected CAC: $20 with $250 LTV (12x ratio).

**Q: What's your biggest risk?**
A: User acquisition in a sensitive market. Death and grief are deeply personal topics, so we need to approach marketing with extreme care and empathy. That's why we're starting with B2B partnerships (funeral homes, prison systems) who already have trust with families. Our content moderation and multi-faith support also help us navigate this sensitivity.

We've mitigated technical risk (platform built), revenue risk (systems activated), and competitive risk (patents filed).

**Q: How defensible is this long-term?**
A: Three layers of defensibility:
1. Patents: 7 innovations with 3-5 year exclusivity
2. Network effects: More memorials → more visitors → more memorials
3. Data moat: Memorial content is permanent, sticky, and grows over time
4. Switching costs: Families won't migrate memorials once created
5. First-mover: Prison contracts require 12-18 month regulatory approvals

**Q: Why do you need $500K-$750K?**
A: We're production-ready but need capital to scale:
- 50% marketing ($250K-$375K): User acquisition, SEO/SEM, content
- 20% partnerships ($100K-$150K): Funeral home outreach, prison pilots
- 10% IP ($50K-$75K): File full utility patents (7 innovations)
- 20% operations ($100K-$150K): Team hires, infrastructure

This gets us to 5,000 users and $200K ARR in 12 months, positioning us for Series A.

**Q: What's your exit strategy?**
A: Three potential paths:
1. Strategic acquisition by Legacy.com or funeral consolidators (Carriage Services, Service Corporation International) - Most likely, 5-7 year timeline
2. Independent growth to profitability and beyond - Platform can generate strong cash flow
3. Public market via SPAC or traditional IPO - Long-term (10+ years)

Comparable exits: Death tech companies typically exit at 6-8x revenue. At $6.7M ARR (Year 5), that's a $40M-$54M valuation. For investors entering at $3.5M pre-money, that's 11-15x return.

**Q: How will you compete with free platforms like Facebook memorials?**
A: Facebook is social media, not a dedicated memorial platform. Key differences:
1. Permanence: Facebook accounts close, content disappears. Opictuary is built for legacy.
2. Privacy: Facebook is public. We offer private, invite-only memorials.
3. Features: We have QR codes, fundraising, funeral programs, future messages - none of which Facebook offers.
4. Dignity: Our design is respectful, multi-faith, and dignified. Facebook is cluttered with ads.
5. Revenue: We help families crowdfund funeral expenses. Facebook doesn't.

We're not competing with Facebook - we're solving a different problem they ignore.

**Q: Why should I invest in you vs. another founder?**
A: Three reasons:
1. **Execution**: Platform is production-ready, not an MVP. I've already done the hard technical work.
2. **Validation**: 88 users, 48% growth, 100% organic. Product-market fit is proven.
3. **Domain expertise**: [Your personal connection to the space - e.g., lost a loved one, worked in funeral industry, etc.]

I'm not asking you to bet on an idea - I'm asking you to bet on execution that's already happening.

## RED FLAGS TO AVOID

### What NOT to Say:

❌ "We have no competition" (Investors know Legacy.com exists)
✅ "We compete in a different niche that Legacy.com has ignored for 27 years"

❌ "We'll be the next Facebook" (Unrealistic comparison)
✅ "We're building the death care platform for the digital age"

❌ "We just need $500K for 6 months of runway" (Runway isn't a milestone)
✅ "We're raising $500K to hit 5,000 users and $200K ARR in 12 months"

❌ "Our projections are conservative" (Everyone says this)
✅ "Here are three scenarios: conservative, base case, and aggressive - with clear assumptions for each"

❌ "We'll figure out the business model later" (Red flag)
✅ "We have 6 activated revenue streams, all tested and working"

### What NOT to Do:

❌ Show up unprepared (know your numbers cold)
❌ Talk for the entire meeting (let them ask questions)
❌ Badmouth competitors (shows immaturity)
❌ Exaggerate traction or capabilities
❌ Get defensive when challenged
❌ Forget to ask for the investment

## SUCCESS METRICS

**Track These Weekly:**
- Emails sent: Target 20/week
- Response rate: Aim for 30%+
- Intro calls scheduled: Target 5/week
- Pitch meetings: Target 2-3/week
- Term sheets: Target 1-2 by week 10

**Conversion Funnel:**
- 100 emails sent
- → 30 responses (30%)
- → 15 intro calls (15%)
- → 8 pitch meetings (8%)
- → 3 due diligence (3%)
- → 1-2 term sheets (1-2%)

**Your Goal:** Close $500K-$750K from 3-5 investors in 10-12 weeks

---

## FINAL TIPS

1. **Start with angels, not VCs:** Angels move faster, write smaller checks, easier to close
2. **Get a lead investor first:** Others will follow once you have momentum
3. **Create urgency:** Set a closing date ("We're closing the round on [date]")
4. **Don't over-optimize terms:** Focus on getting capital from great investors
5. **Use SAFE or convertible note:** Simpler, faster, less legal fees than priced round
6. **Keep building:** Best fundraising traction is continuous product/user growth
7. **Be transparent:** Honesty builds trust, even when sharing challenges
8. **Follow up relentlessly:** Most deals die from lack of follow-up, not lack of interest
